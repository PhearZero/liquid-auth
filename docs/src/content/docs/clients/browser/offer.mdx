<Aside type="caution">
  Ensure both clients have a valid session before attempting to create peer connections.
  See the [Authentication](/docs/clients/browser/authentication) and [Registration]() guides for more information.
</Aside>

[Peer-to-Peer](/guides/concepts/#peer-to-peer) connections can only be done using the `SignalClient`.
Wallets are responsible for creating offers to connect.

### Who is this for?

- **Browser Wallets** that want to communicate with other clients

## Signaling

```typescript
import { SignalClient } from "@algorandfoundation/liquid-client";
const client = new SignalClient("<ORIGIN-FROM-QR-CODE>")

// Receive the RequestID from the Peer willing to Answer this offer
const requestId = "<UUID-FROM-QR-CODE>"

// Register or create a new credential,
// ensure the requestId is included in the call
// ...

// Create the Peer Connection and await the remote client's answer
const dc = await client.peer(
  // Request ID from the Peer,
  // usually displayed as a Deep Link or QR Code
  requestId,
  // Type of remote client
  'answer'
)
```

## Data Channel[WIP]

We are working on a more robust way to handle data channel messages. For now, you can use the following:

```typescript
dc.onmessage = (event: MessageEvent) => {
    console.log(event.data)
  }
dc.send('Hello world!')
```

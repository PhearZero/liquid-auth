title: 'Browser: Peer Answer'
---

The answer client is used to respond to a remote client's offer.
The remote client will have sent an offer to the answer client, which will then respond with an answer.

### Who is this for?

- **dApps** that want to leverage liquid-auth to connect to other clients
- **Mobile Wallets** that want to tailor the onboarding and connect experience
- **Browser Wallets** that want to communicate with other clients

### Request ID

Answer clients are responsible for creating the request id.
Request IDs are given to the remote peer, usually as a deep-link encoded into a QR Code.
This ID is used by the remote peer to authenticate the current client.

```typescript
import { SignalClient } from '@algorandfoundation/liquid-client';
const requestId = SignalClient.generateRequestId();
```

## Signaling

```typescript
client
    .peer(requestId, 'offer')
    .then((dataChannel: RTCDataChannel)=>{
        // Handle the data channel
        dataChannel.onmessage = (event: MessageEvent) => {
            console.log(event.data)
        }
    })
const blob = await client.qrCode()
// Display QR Code
```

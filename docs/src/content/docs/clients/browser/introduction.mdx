The `SignalClient` is an EventEmitter interface
that can be used
to communicate with the [Service](../../server/introduction).
It's designed to facilitate authentication and peer-to-peer communications.
The interface is composed of methods that can be manually executed.

### Who is this for?

- **dApps** that want to leverage liquid-auth to connect to other clients
- **Mobile Wallets** that want to tailor the onboarding and connect experience
- **Browser Wallets** that want to communicate with other clients

## Install
```bash
npm install algorandfoundation/liquid-auth-js --save
````

## Get Started

<Aside>The service must be running as the origin server. See the [server integrations](../../server/integrations) documentation</Aside>

### Use-Wallet [WIP]
We recommend using [use-wallet](https://github.com/TxnLab/use-wallet) from [TxnLabs](https://www.txnlab.dev/).
Check back soon for more details.

### Manual Integration



```typescript
//app.ts
import {SignalClient} from '@algorandfoundation/liquid-client';
const client = new SignalClient(window.origin);
```

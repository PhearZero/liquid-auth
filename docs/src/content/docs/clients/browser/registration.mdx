Register a [Passkey](../../guides/concepts#passkeys) with the [Service](../../server/introduction) and attest the knowledge of a KeyPair.

### Who is this for?

- **Browser Wallets** that want to communicate with the service and other clients

## Client

Creating a passkey and registering it with the service using an instance of the `SignalClient`

```typescript
// browser.client.ts
import * as nacl from 'tweetnacl'
import {toBase64URL} from '@algorandfoundation/liquid-client/encoding'

// Sign in to the service with a new credential and wallet
await client.attestation(
  // Callback when a challenge is received, return a signed challenge
  async (challenge: Uint8Array) => ({
    // The type of signature and public key
    type: 'algorand',
    // The address of the account
    address: account.addr,
    // The signature of the challenge, signed by the account
    signature: toBase64URL(nacl.sign.detached(challenge, account.sk)),
    // Optionally authenticate a remote peer
    requestId: 12345,
    // Optional device name
    device: 'Demo Web Wallet'
  })
)

```

## Stateless

Creating a passkey without using the `SignalClient`

```typescript
import {attestation} from '@algorandfoundation/liquid-client/attestation'
import {toBase64URL} from '@algorandfoundation/liquid-client/encoding'
await attestation(
  "https://my-liquid-service.com",
  // Callback when a challenge is received, return a signed challenge
  async (challenge: Uint8Array) => ({
    // The type of signature and public key
    type: 'algorand',
    // The address of the account
    address: account.addr,
    // The signature of the challenge, signed by the account
    signature: toBase64URL(nacl.sign.detached(challenge, account.sk)),
    // Optionally authenticate a remote peer
    requestId: 12345,
    // Optional device name
    device: 'Demo Web Wallet'
  })
)
```

Register a [Passkey](../../guides/concepts#passkeys) with the [Service](../../server/introduction) and attest the knowledge of a KeyPair.

### Who is this for?

- **Browser Wallets** that want to communicate with the service and other clients

## Client

Creating a passkey and registering it with the service using an instance of the `SignalClient`.

`attestation` is a convenience method that handles the entire process of creating a passkey and registering it with the service.
The caller must provide a callback that will be called when a challenge is received from the service.

```typescript
// browser.client.ts
import * as nacl from 'tweetnacl'
import {toBase64URL} from '@algorandfoundation/liquid-client/encoding'

// Sign in to the service with a new credential and wallet
await client.attestation(
  // Callback when a challenge is received, return a signed challenge
  async (challenge: Uint8Array) => ({
    // The type of signature and public key
    type: 'algorand',
    // The address of the account
    address: address,
    // The signature of the challenge, signed by the account
    signature: toBase64URL(nacl.sign.detached(challenge, seceretKey)),
    // Optionally authenticate a remote peer
    requestId: "<UUID_FROM_QR_CODE>",
    // Optional device name
    device: 'Demo Web Wallet'
  })
)

```

## Stateless

Using the `attestation` method to create a passkey without using the `SignalClient`

```typescript
import * as nacl from 'tweetnacl'
import {attestation} from '@algorandfoundation/liquid-client/attestation'
import {toBase64URL} from '@algorandfoundation/liquid-client/encoding'

await attestation(
  "https://my-liquid-service.com",
  // Callback when a challenge is received, return a signed challenge
  async (challenge: Uint8Array) => ({
    // The type of signature and public key
    type: 'algorand',
    // The address of the account
    address: address,
    // The signature of the challenge, signed by the account
    signature: toBase64URL(nacl.sign.detached(challenge, seceretKey)),
    // Optionally authenticate a remote peer
    requestId: 12345,
    // Optional device name
    device: 'Demo Web Wallet'
  })
)
```

## Manual

If you want to manually handle the process of creating a passkey, you can use the following methods and preforming
the three steps of the process.

### üßÆ Options

Manually fetching the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions" target="_blank">PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions</a> from the service.

```typescript
import {fetchAttestationRequest} from '@algorandfoundation/liquid-client/attestation'

const encodedOptions = await fetchAttestationRequest("https://my-liquid-service.com")
```

### ‚ú® Creating

Decode the options and create a new passkey.

```typescript
import {decodeAddress, fromBase64Url} from "@algorandfoundation/liquid-client/encoding";
const options = { ...encodedOptions };
  // Uint8Array of the user's id, is set as the encoded address for this type of key
  options.user.id = decodeAddress(address);
  // Must be string that is equal to the id bytes using the appropriate encoding
  options.user.name = address;
  // Friendly name to display for the user
  options.user.displayName = "Hello World";
  // Challenge from the service
  options.challenge = fromBase64Url(options.challenge);

  // Decode any known credentials
  if (options.excludeCredentials) {
    for (const cred of options.excludeCredentials) {
      cred.id = fromBase64Url(cred.id);
    }
}
const credential = navigator.credentials.create({
  publicKey: options
})

```

### üîê Liquid Extension

Sign the challenge with an additional KeyPair.

```typescript
import * as nacl from 'tweetnacl'
import {toBase64URL} from '@algorandfoundation/liquid-client/encoding'

credential.clientExtensionResults = {
    // The type of signature and public key, this is also used
    // to determine the type of encoding for the user.id
    type: 'algorand',
    // The address of the account
    address: address,
    // The signature of the challenge, signed by the account
    signature: toBase64URL(nacl.sign.detached(options.challenge, seceretKey)),
    // Optionally authenticate a remote peer
    requestId: "<UUID_FROM_QR_CODE>",
    // Optional device name
    device: 'Demo Web Wallet'
}
```

### üöö Response

Encode and submit the passkey to the service.

```typescript
import {fetchAttestationResponse} from '@algorandfoundation/liquid-client/attestation'
import {toBase64URL} from '@algorandfoundation/liquid-client/encoding'

const result = await fetchAttestationResponse("https://my-liquid-service.com", {
    id: credential.id,
    rawId: toBase64URL(credential.rawId),
    type: credential.type,
    response: {
      clientDataJSON: toBase64URL(response.clientDataJSON),
      attestationObject: toBase64URL(response.attestationObject),
    },
    clientExtensionResults: credential.clientExtensionResults
  })
```

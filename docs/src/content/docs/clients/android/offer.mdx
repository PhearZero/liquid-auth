<Aside type="caution">
  Ensure both clients have a valid session before attempting to create peer connections.
  See the [Authentication](./authentication) and [Registration](./registration) guides for more information.
</Aside>

[Peer-to-Peer]() connections can only be done using the `SignalClient`.
Wallets are responsible for creating offers to connect.

## Signaling

```kotlin
val requestID = 12345 // Scanned from a QR Code or Deep Link
val origin = "https://my-liquid-service.com" // Origin of the service
val client = SignalClient(origin, context, httpClient)
val dc = signalClient?.peer(requestId, "answer" )
```

title: 'Android: Peer Offer'

import {Aside} from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Aside type="caution">
  Ensure both clients have a valid session before attempting to create peer connections.
  See the [Authentication](./authentication) and [Registration](./registration) guides for more information.
</Aside>

[Peer-to-Peer](/guides/concepts/#peer-to-peer) connections can only be done using the `SignalClient`.
Wallets are responsible for creating offers to connect.

### Who is this for?

- **Android Wallets** that want to communicate with other clients

## Signaling

```kotlin
// Example.kt
import foundation.algorand.auth.connect.SignalClient

val requestID = "UUID-STRING-FROM-QR-CODE" // Scanned from a QR Code or Deep Link
val origin = "https://<ORIGIN-OF-SERVICE-FROM-QR-CODE>" // Origin of the service
val client = SignalClient(origin, context, httpClient)
val dc = client.peer(requestId, "answer" )
```

## Data Channel[WIP]

We are working on a more robust way to handle data channel messages. For now, you can use the following:

```kotlin
// Example.kt

client.handleDataChannel(dc, {
    Log.d(TAG, "onMessage($it)")
}, {
    Log.d(TAG, "onStateChange($it)")
})
```

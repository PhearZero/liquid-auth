Liquid Auth is a set of primitives that requires ecosystems to implement their own strategies.
The primitives required to adopt the service are composed of two parts, [Authentication](#authentication) extensions and message [Providers](#providers).

The Browser/Android clients do not handle signing or any cryptographic primitives.
Their responsibilities are limited to interacting with the Service and establishing Peer to Peer connections.

### Who is this for?

- **Ecosystems** that want to adopt and extend `Liquid Auth` for their own purposes.


## Authentication

<Aside>Additional strategies will require contributions to the Service.</Aside>

It is up to the ecosystems to decide what authentication strategy works best in their contexts.
We have decided to use Passkeys + Proof of Private Keys.
Other ecosystems are encouraged to develop their own strategies to be included in the reference Service.

Feel free to add a [Feature Request](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/liquid-auth/issues/new/choose) or submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/liquid-auth)
that includes your ecosystem's authentication strategy.

### Passkeys

As shown in the [Extension Guide](/guides/passkey/extension/#-registration),
the reference [Service](/server/introduction) only supports one type of authentication.
The extension can be any additional claim that you wish the Passkey to represent.

In the case of Algorand, this is proving the ownership of a private key along with the proof of a Passkey.
We include an optional `requestId` which can be used to authenticate a remote session and join them to the user's channel.
The following illustrates a Passkey with the additional Algorand focused attestation:

```json add={7-11}
{
    "id": "AYMPi2Rbhcnu2gSHOO1TNvzDJ38iU00rrlCqyH874XCIEoIotRc7eVRFpx0TvsQurg7BAnXy5KnWdKC8LeWs0k0",
    "type": "public-key",
    "rawId": "AYMPi2Rbhcnu2gSHOO1TNvzDJ38iU00rrlCqyH874XCIEoIotRc7eVRFpx0TvsQurg7BAnXy5KnWdKC8LeWs0k0",
    "clientExtensionResults": {
      "liquid": {
        "type": "algorand",

      }
    },

    }
  }
```

Custom attestation strategies can be as simple or complex as required.
The main focus is a unique identifier of the user and the optional RequestId for authenticating a remote peer.

```json add={8-9}
{
    "clientExtensionResults": {
      "liquid": {
        "type": "addition",
        "a":  1,
        "b": 2,
        "sum": 3,
        "address": "Unique Identifier for the User",
        "requestId": "REMOTE_UUID_REQUEST_ID"
      }
    },
    ...
  }
```

## Providers

<Aside>This does not require any additional contributions to the Service or Clients.</Aside>

One of the main features of the Liquid Extension and Service is the ability to create Peer to Peer connections.
This feature is guarded by the authentication mechanism, both peers must be authenticated prior to establishing a peer connection.

The protocol does not specify what should go over the wire and ecosystems are required to adopt their own
strategies for handling messages.
Once the client is connected, you will receive the datachannel and can apply any strategies between the peers

```javascript
client
    .peer("UUID_FOR_REMOTE_AUTH", 'offer')
    .then((dc)=>{
      dc.onmessage = (e) => {
          // Handle Ecosystem Messages
      }
      // Handle Creation of Ecosystem Messages
      dc.send()
    })

```

An **Answer** is a type of session that is initiated by a client
and is used to respond to an **Offer** from another client.
The Answer client is responsible for presenting the [Deep Link](/guides/linking/#deep-link) to the Offer client and waiting for the response.

### Who is this for?

- **dApps/Wallets** that want to peer with Wallets in the ecosystem.
- **Wallets** that want to integrate deeply into `Liquid Auth` and tailor the experience.

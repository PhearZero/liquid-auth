Both clients listen for each other's **Offer** and **Answer** messages at the relay service.
Once the [Deep Link](/guides/linking/#deep-link) is received,
the **Offer** client proves its identity using the [Liquid Extension](/guides/passkey/extension)
then sends an **Offer** message to the **Answer** client.
The **Answer** client then sends an **Answer** message to the **Offer** client.

    B->>C: Emit Offer to Origin
    C-->>A: Emit Offer to Client
    A->>C: Emit Answer to Origin
    C-->>B: Emit Answer to Client
```

## ICE Candidates

The clients exchange ICE candidates to establish a connection.
The ICE candidates are used to determine the best path for the data to travel between the clients.
The clients exchange ICE candidates over the signaling server via WebSockets.

    participant A as Answer Client
    participant C as Liquid Service
    participant B as Offer Client
    A->>A: Gather ICE Candidates
    A->>C: Send ICE Candidates
    C->>B: Send ICE Candidates
    B->>B: Gather ICE Candidates
    B->>C: Send ICE Candidates
    C->>A: Send ICE Candidates
```

### Candidate Discovery

STUN and TURN servers are used as a fallback when a local connection cannot be established on the LAN.
The STUN server is used to discover the client's public IP address,
while the TURN server is used to relay data if a direct connection to public IP cannot be established.

The following diagram shows the exchange of STUN/TURN candidates with a client.

```mermaid

    participant A as Peer A
    participant B as STUN Service
    participant C as TURN Service
    A->>A: Get Local Candidates
    A->>B: Get STUN Candidates
    B-->>A: Send STUN Candidates
    A->>C: Get TURN Relay Candidates
    C-->>A: Send TURN Relay Candidates
```

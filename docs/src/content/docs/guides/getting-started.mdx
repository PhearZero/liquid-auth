Liquid Auth is composed of two main components, the **Liquid Auth Server** and the **Liquid Auth Clients**.
They are used together to provide authentication and signaling services for decentralized applications (dApps).


## 🚀 Use Case

The service should be provided by the **dApp** and the **Wallets** should act as clients.
The **Wallet** will receive the `Origin` and `RequestId` from the `dApp` and will use it
to authenticate with the service provided as the `Origin`.

#### 📝 Requirements

- **Wallets** should implement the **Offer** `SignalClient` and `WebAuthn Extension` to establish a peer-to-peer connection with the **dApp**.
- **dApps** should implement the **Answer** `SignalClient` and host the Service.

There are a few key concepts that are important to understand when working with Liquid Auth.
The main concepts are `Linking`, `Passkeys`, and `Peer-to-Peer`.
See the full details in the [Architecture Reference](../../architecture).

## ðŸ”— Linking

A link will authorize a remote client to access the service.
This is done by generating a `RequestId` and waiting for a device to attest a Passkey.

## ðŸ”’ Passkeys

Passkeys are also known as FIDO2/WebAuthn [PublicKeyCredential](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PublicKeyCredential).
This KeyPair is used to register or authenticate a user and is generated by an authenticator device.

### FIDO2 Extension

Authenticators must also support the `Liquid Extension` which is used to attest a `KeyPair` not controlled by the authenticator.

This extension attaches an additional signature to the credential to associate the `KeyPair` with the `Passkey`.
The extension also includes an optional `requestId` which is used to link the `KeyPair` to a specific session.
When two clients are linked, they can establish a peer-to-peer connection.

## ðŸ”„ Peer-to-Peer

[WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) is used for establishing a peer-to-peer connection between two clients.

#### Offer

Session Description Protocol (SDP) message sent from the client to the server. The offer contains information about the client's media capabilities and information about the datachannel.

#### Answer

Session Description Protocol (SDP) message sent back to a client who created the Offer.
An Answer client can then use this information to generate an answer, which is sent back to the offer client.

#### Candidate

ICE Candidate is a network address that can be used to communicate with the peer.

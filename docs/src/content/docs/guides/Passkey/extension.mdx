This is a [WebAuthn extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API/WebAuthn_extensions) that allows the service to verify the authenticity of a `KeyPair` using a `Passkey`.
The extension is used during the [Registration](/guides/passkey/registration) and [Authentication](/guides/passkey/authentication) of Passkeys.

It is the heart of operations for the `Liquid` service and is required for registration and peer-to-peer connections.

### Who is this for?

- **Wallets/Credential Managers** that want to adopt Liquid Auth.
- **Ecosystems** that want to leverage the `Liquid Extension` for their networks.



## ðŸ§® Options

The service will expect the following options to be passed with the `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions` and `PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions`:

```javascript
const body = {
    //...options
    "extensions": {
      "liquid": true
    }
  }
```

This tells the service that the request is using the Liquid extension and expects to receive a `Passkey` with additional information.


## ðŸ§ª Handling Passkey

As of this writing, currently no Authenticators support the `liquid` extension natively. The extension must be handled by the integrators

If you are developing an Authenticator, you will need to handle the `liquid` extension in the `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions` and `PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions`.

Feel free to edit this document if you have an Authenticator that supports the `liquid` extension.


## ðŸšš Response

The response message should include the extension results in the `liquid` key if it was enabled in the `Options`.
It is mandatory to include the extension when registering new credentials with the Service.


### âœ¨ Registration

<Aside>Ecosystems can add custom attestation strategies to the Passkey by providing their own `type` of liquid extension</Aside>

The reference implementation of the extension currently only supports the `algorand` type.
It allows associating an Algorand address with the Passkey.

```javascript
const response = {
    //...response from authenticator
    "clientExtensionResults": {
      "liquid": {
        // Required for the extension
        "type": "algorand",
        // The address of the account in Algorand Encoding
        "address": "2SPDE6XLJNXFTOO7OIGNRNKSEDOHJWVD3HBSEAPHONZQ4IQEYOGYTP6LXA",
        // Signature of the challenge that was produced by the Service
        "signature": "QY31mdH8AwpJ9p4pCXBO2iA5WdU-BjG52xEtJNuSJNHJIaJ10uzqk3FdR0fvYVfb_rzXTuWn4k1PFFeg-vpEDw",
        // Optional RequestId to authenticate a remote peer
        "requestId": "019097ff-bb8c-7514-a0c6-5209d2405a4a",
        // Optional name for the device
        "device": "Pixel 8 Pro"
      }
    }
}
```

### ðŸŽ‰ Authentication

When using a previously registered Passkey, the client does not require the liquid extension.
The service has attested to the additional keypair which represents an account and can rely on the WebAuthn standard for authentication.


Although the extension is not required, it is useful for establishing a Peer-to-Peer connection.


```javascript
const response = {
    //...response from authenticator
    "clientExtensionResults": {
      "liquid": {
        // Optional RequestId to authenticate a remote peer
        "requestId": "019097ff-bb8c-7514-a0c6-5209d2405a4a"
      }
    }
}
```
